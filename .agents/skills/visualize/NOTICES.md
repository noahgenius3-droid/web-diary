# Design-system notices

Design systems under `visualize/design-systems/<name>-style/` are independent
reference implementations inspired by public brand surfaces. Repository-level
notices for vendored runtime bundles are collected here.

## Brand reference

Design systems with a `-style` suffix (`stripe-style`, `figma-style`, …) are
independent reference implementations inspired by the public visual language
of well-known brands. They are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
representative of the named companies. All brand names and trademarks remain
the property of their respective owners.
## Vendored bundles (`scripts/vendor/`)

The skill vendors a small set of npm-distributed libraries as single-file bundles so the detector and browser-contrast sidecar work after `npx skills add display-dev/visualize` with no `npm install` step. Per-file version, size, and sha256 are recorded in [`scripts/vendor/README.md`](scripts/vendor/README.md).

- `culori` — MIT — https://github.com/Evercoder/culori

The combined `puppeteer.mjs` bundle inlines transitive code under MIT, ISC, and Apache-2.0 — representative packages include `debug`, `ws`, `chromium-bidi`, `tar-fs`, `tar-stream`, `yargs`, `progress`, `streamx`, `b4a`, `fast-fifo`, `cliui`. Legal comments and SPDX identifiers from each upstream package are preserved inline via `esbuild --legal-comments=inline`; consult the bundle directly for the authoritative per-package text.

## Adapted color guidance

`reference/color.md` adapts selected procedural principles and color vocabulary, with new wording and scope for Visualize. No external executable code, tools, or third-party reference collection is imported.

## Adapted system-exploration guidance

`reference/explore-system.md` adapts the distinction between established, incomplete, absent, and replacement visual authority from Paul Bakaus’s [Impeccable new-work guidance](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable/blob/f88b2837a7d7c3182e46307bbbb091a1ed547571/skill/reference/new-work.md), revision `f88b2837a7d7c3182e46307bbbb091a1ed547571` (Apache-2.0; [license](reference/licenses/impeccable-Apache-2.0.txt)). Adapted on 2026-08-28 with new wording and Visualize’s comparison, confirmation, and local recovery procedure. No seed engine, decision UI, command structure, or executable code is imported. Shared color adaptations are attributed above.
