// Greenfield brand-seed picker for visualize.
//
// When a project has no DESIGN.md and no usable repo guidance, creation
// should not collapse to the same Clean monochrome default every time.
// This helper returns one curated OKLCH anchor plus computed composition
// math and the rules that bite at composition time. The agent still
// composes the actual tokens from the brief; the seed is an
// anti-monoculture nudge, not a frozen palette.
//
// Design (schemaVersion 2):
//   - Seeds are stratified into 12 hue zones (30° buckets) plus a neutral
//     zone (C < 0.04). A pick draws a zone uniformly among occupied zones,
//     then a seed uniformly within it — sparse zones surface as often as
//     dense ones, so library skew never becomes pick skew.
//   - Every draw comes from one mulberry32 PRNG seeded from sha256 of the
//     key (or from crypto.randomBytes when keyless), so `--from` is
//     byte-identical across machines and Node versions. Never engine
//     randomness on the keyed path.
//   - `derived` carries computed color math the model should not estimate:
//     per-hue sRGB chroma budgets (the budget varies ~2x by hue — a flat
//     cap is wrong in both directions), real WCAG + APCA contrast numbers,
//     and light + dark lightness ladders with exact floors.
//   - `--check` validates a composed tokens block (or a full HTML artifact)
//     against the hard rules before render. Findings mirror detect.mjs
//     (`{ruleId, severity, locator, message}`, NDJSON with --json,
//     exit 2 on errors with --strict).
//
// Usage:
//   node palette.mjs                          # random pick (exploration)
//   node palette.mjs --from "<topic>"         # deterministic pick (default in create flow)
//   node palette.mjs --from "<topic>" --vary 2          # salted re-draw, stable until n changes
//   node palette.mjs --from "<topic>" --not red,pink    # veto zones (or seed ids), still deterministic
//   node palette.mjs --id verdigris           # explicit seed
//   node palette.mjs --list                   # id / zone / polarity / oklch for every seed
//   node palette.mjs --check tokens.css       # validate composed tokens (also accepts .html, or stdin via -)
//   node palette.mjs --check artifact.html --json --strict
//
// Env:
//   VISUALIZE_PALETTE_SEED — same as --from.
//
// Zone vocabulary for --not:
//   red orange gold yellow lime green teal azure blue violet purple pink neutral
